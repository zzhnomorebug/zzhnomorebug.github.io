excerpt: 'This work addresses the challenge of learning from cluttered and irregularly sampled sequential data by proposing a novel decoupling-based approach. The method explicitly separates a complex system into multiple latent sub-systems and a meta-system that captures their interactions over time. To achieve this, the interactions are modeled using projected differential equations (ProjDEs) with neural-friendly projection operators inspired by Bregman divergence. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in handling complex and cluttered sequential dataâ€‹.'
