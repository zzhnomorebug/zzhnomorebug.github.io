excerpt: 'This paper introduces SDDiff, a diffusion-based model for molecular conformation generation that operates on inter-atomic distances to ensure SE(3)-equivariance. Instead of assuming a Gaussian distribution for distance perturbations, SDDiff derives a shifting score function based on molecular thermodynamics, modeling how inter-atomic distance changes transition from a Gaussian to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution under increasing noise. This formulation provides a more physically grounded way to reverse the diffusion process, ensuring more feasible molecular geometries.'
